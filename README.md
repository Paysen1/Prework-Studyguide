## My modivation for this website was to look back on as my first ever coding feat. I built this project to help give me a hands on look into what foes into building a webpage. This solves the problem of searching for my notes and informatin and overall first impretions of the course. I learned lots of valuable things about different languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## This website will be used to keep notes and useful information about what I have, and will learn throughout this course. It includes notes on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Looking into the DevTools you can also see the changes and topics that will be shown on this website. I look forward to using this website often in my course and for anyone wishing to learn what I have learned in this course so far!
